## Submission Requirements

All platformer demon records require a screenshot of the completed level, and the time taken to beat.

Having a Pemonlist record accepted can boost credibility as well as raw footage, although these wonâ€™t be necessary unless the record has been deemed suspicious. Level of scrutiny is dependent on the levels difficulty and the record holders hardest.

Completions with Click Between Frames enabled are allowed on the list, however there will be a note on your record displaying CBF usage.
